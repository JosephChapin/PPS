	<h2><b>The Game:</b></h2>
	<p> Ping Pong Soccer takes a little bit of the best of a number of sports. It is meant to be played in a relaxed, pickup setting, so do not let these rules deter you from playing if you do not have access to all of the necessary equimpment, a field, etc. there are a number of ways to adapt the game that make it possible to play nearly anywhere. But, in the event of a tournament style setting or if you have access to everything you need, here are the rules that we have found to be most fun and fair. </p>

	<h3><b>Setup:</b></h3>

	<p> As you can see above, there are a couple of ways to setup the field. You can have a half-court game (recommended for 3v3 and 2v2 or even an oddnumbered game with a designated goalie) or a full-court game (recommended for games from 4v4 to 6v6). However, the goals should be ideally standard lacrosse goals, but any type of goal that suites the size of your field/number of players will do. If playing an oddnumbered game with a goaly, having a slightly larger goal is recommended, for example, a standard field hockey goal would be ideal.</p>

	<h4><b>Half-Court Setup</b></h4>

	<p> The half-court game setup is most closely based upon that of a half-court basketball game. Crucially, there is a "clearing line" that mimics taking the ball past mid-court on a full court which changes possession allowing the previously defensive team to shoot on goal and score. Additionally, any goals from beyond the clearing line count as two points. However, any defelction by the offensive team from inside the clearing line makes it once again a one point goal. The clearing line is preferably in an arc shape around the goal, but not necessarily if the court you have chosen does not easily allow for this. </p>

	<p> Inside the arc is the free-shot line, ideally 20 feet from the goal, and the "crease," which is a small areat around the goal that determines whether or not a downed ball will be a free shot or free pass in.</p>

	<h4><b>Full-Court Setup</b></h4>

	<p> The full-court game setup largely refelects the half-court game, but the change of possession is more fluid and fast-breaks are more possible. The goals should still not be too far apart as a ping pong ball obviously does not travel up and down a field as quickly as a soccer or football.</p>

	<h3><b>Gameplay:</b></h3>
	<h4><b>Scoring</b></h4>
	<p> Scoring is relatively simple. The ball must cross the goal line before hitting the ground after deflecting off of any player's paddle body as long as the shot is not indirect, which would only be the case on a "free pass" (explained below in possession). In the half-court game specifically, the offensive team (explained ) receives a point when the ball crosses the goal line</p>

	<h4><b>Movement and Dribbling</b></h4>
	<p> Much like basketball, a player maintaining possession of the ball may not move without bouncing the ball off of his/her paddle (dribbling). Clearly, players not in immediate possession of the ball, both on offense and on defense may move without dribbling. </p>

	<h4><b>Posession</b></h4>
	<p> Posession is a key part of both play styles, but is central to the half-court game.  A team can only score a point (for their own team that is) when in posession of the ball. Posession is determined by the "clearing line." A team must only touch the ball past the clearing line to gain posession and then they may continue on towards the goal to score. To be clear, they need not maintain full posession beyond the clearing line in order to achieve posession in terms of scoring. </p>

	<h4><b>Free Pass</b></h4>
	<p> So what happens when the ball ineveitably hits the ground? At this point the team who last made contact with the ball (paddle <i>or</i> body part) turns the ball over to the other team. Official posession (as far as scoring is concerned) does not turnover still until the defensive team brings the ball past the clearing line.</p>
	<p> The team that controls the ball at this point may have a free pass. The emphasis here is on "pass." A free pass may not be directly scored and the player making the free pass may not move until he has passed the ball. The passer's intention may be to score, but the goal will not count unless the ball makes contact with at least one other player or his/her paddle before crossing the goal line. This assumes that the ball has fallen on the ground within the normal field of play. Other scenarios will be discussed shortly. </p>
	<p> If the ball, however, falls on the ground out of bounds, the team that ends up with the ball may choose as to whether or not they want to staart with the ball "up top" if playing half-court. But, if the game is full-court, they simply must pass the ball in from where it went out of bounds along the sideline. </p>
	<p> Finally, the ball may fall within one other important space, "the crease." The crease is a small space around the goal that marks out the space where the offensive team can earn a free shot, which will be discussed in more depth immediately below. </p>

	<h4><b>Free Shot</b></h4>
	<p> Upon earning a free shot, the offensive team gets to choose which player on their team they want to take the shot. This player will then shoot from behind the free shot line (marked on the accompanying field layouts) against the goalie, or a player of choice of the defensive team. </p>
	<p> Upon a deflection off of a post of the goal or the goalie on a free shot, the ball is immediately in play. If the goalie deflects the ball and the ball hits no one else before touching the ground, the defensive team still takes control of the ball earning themselves a free pass (or a free take-back if the ball lands out-of-bounds) as the goalie should earn a reward for saving the shot. </p>

	<h4><b>Fouls and 50-50 Balls</b></h4>
	<p> Ping pong soccer is meant to be a game of finese and positioning, not a game of brute force. As a result, excessive/intentional body contact is a foul as well as uncontrolled aggression (with one's paddle or one's body). However, there is regularly a situation when a player from each team reaches strong positioning at roughly the same time and it is difficult to tell which one is holding the dominant position. In this case, unintentional and unaggressive body contact is allowed, as long as both players are clearly making movements towards the ball.  </p>
	<p> However, in the event of a foul, it is treated exactly like a dropped ball. The team with the player who was the "victim" of the foul earns a free pass or free shot depending on possession and location of the foul on the field. </p>
