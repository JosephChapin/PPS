<h2><b>The Game:</b></h2>
<p> Ping Pong Soccer takes a little bit of the best of a number of sports. It is meant to be played in a relaxed, pickup setting, so do not let these rules deter you from playing if you do not have access to all of the necessary equimpment, a field, etc. there are a number of ways to adapt the game that make it possible to play nearly anywhere. But, in the event of a tournament style setting or if you have access to everything you need, here are the rules that we have found to be most fun and fair. </p>

<h3><b>Setup:</b></h3>


<p> As you can see above, there are a couple of ways to setup the field. You can have a half-court game (recommended for 3v3 and 2v2 or even an oddnumbered game with a designated goaly) or a full-court game (recommended for games from 4v4 to 6v6).</p>

<h4><b>Half-Court Setup</b></h4>

<p> The half-court game setup is most closely based upon that of a half-court basketball game. Crucially, there is a "clearing line" that mimics taking the ball past mid-court on a full court which changes possession allowing the previously defensive team to shoot on goal and score. Additionally, any goals from beyond the clearing line count as two points. However, any defelction by the offensive team from inside the clearing line makes it once again a one point goal. The clearing line is preferably in an arc shape around the goal, but not necessarily if the court you have chosen does not easily allow for this. </p>

<p> Inside the arc is the free-shot line, ideally 20 feet from the goal, and the "crease," which is a small areat around the goal that determines whether or not a downed ball will be a free shot or free pass in.</p>

<h4><b>Full-Court Setup</b></h4>

<p> The full-court game setup largely refelects the half-court game, but the change of possession is more fluid and fast-breaks are more possible. The goals should still not be too far apart as a ping pong ball obviously does not travel up and down a field as quickly as a soccer or football.</p>

<h3><b>Gameplay:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Scoring</b></h4>
<p> Scoring is relatively simple. The ball must cross the goal line before hitting the ground after deflecting off of any player's paddle body as long as the shot is not indirect, which would only be the case on a "free pass" (explained below in possession). In the half-court game specifically, the offensive team (explained ) receives a point when the ball crosses the goal line</p>

<h4><b>Posession</b></h4>
<p> Posession is a key part of both play styles, but is central to the half-court game.  A team can only score a point (for their own team that is) when in posession of the ball. Posession is determined by the "clearing line."  </p>
